# IV_Swinger
The IV Swinger is an IV curve tracer for photovoltaic solar panels. Both the hardware design and the software are open source.

This GitHub repository contains the IV Swinger documentation, software and open source licensing files.

IV Swinger 2 is here! It is much smaller, cheaper and easier to build, and better than the original in almost every way. The hardware design and construction documentation will be added to the repository soon. The software and the User Guide are available now.
